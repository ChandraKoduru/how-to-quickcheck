Basically I need to construct generators (Gen a) for all the types for which I need random samples for testing.

generate :: Gen a -> IO a

The generate function takes in a 'generator' and yields random samples

Another utility function that could be useful in viewing samples generated by generator.

sample :: Gen a -> IO ()
sample' :: Gen a -> IO [a]

The above just calls the repeatedly generator and prints the output to the stdio.

sample :: Gen a -> IO ()
sample gen_a = sample' gen_a 10
    where
        sample' gen_a n | n <= 0 = return ()
                        | otherwise = do
                                        a <- generate gen_a
                                        putStrLn (show a)
                                        sample' gen_a (n-1)

### Making generators

Using combinators

choose :: (a, a) -> Gen a
elements :: [a] -> Gen a

Becoming an instance of Arbitrary type class.

class Arbitrary a where
    arbitrary :: Gen a

generate $ choose (1, 2)
generate $ elements [1,2,3]
generate $ (arbitrary :: Gen Int)

It is simpler, easier in practice to make instances of the Arbitrary for our data types.

#### Becoming instances of Arbitrary

There is already enough supply of helper functions constructing arbitrary instances for recursive structures of basic types 
eg. Bool, Int, Char, String, Tuple, Lists, Maybe, Either etc..

#### Using applicative(<$>) and functor (<*>) since Gen is a Monad -> Applicative -> Functor (excluding the monadic laws)

data MyType = MyType {
    foo :: Int,
  , bar :: Bool,
  , baz :: Char
} deriving (Show)

myTypeGenerator :: Gen MyType
myTypeGenerator = MyType <$> arbitrary <*>  arbitrary <*> arbitrary

generate myTypeGenerator :: IO MyType

#### Finer control to generate the samples

oneof :: [Gen a] -> Gen a -- almost even distribution among the available generators
frequency :: [(Int, Gen a)] -> Gen a -- frequency control/mixing
sized :: (Int -> Gen a) -> Gen a -- controlling the size of the generated sample

## Properties

Properties are predicates that can be checked by testing. QuickCheck represents them am *Gen Result*
